# Multithreaded Battleship
A multithreaded, two-player, terminal version of the popular Milton Bradley game, Battleship. Based off my very first collegiate programming assignment, with a few new tricks to show off.


# Version 1.0
- Game runs in one terminal window only (multithreading to be introduced in later versions)
- No computer AI (yet, introduce this feature in later versions)
